A digital interface to support intercultural relationship building (SIGGRAPH ASIA 2019)

Come to the Table! employs an extended reality interface, centred around a domestic kitchen table, as a first step towards overcoming racial tensions by inviting indigenous MƒÅori, people from migrant backgrounds and all others to join viewers, thereby fostering intercultural relationship building.


This section explains the implementation of AR set up used. We used two AR headsets(Meta 2) for the experiment. Both the devices were synchronized over a network connection.


# REQUIREMENTS
- Two AR headsets
- Two Intel Realsense 400 series cameras (we used D415 cameras)
- For real-time syncing between computers, we used OSC triggers triggered from another computer
- We have used Unity 2019.1.1f1, but should be backwards compatible.

# TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS


### Structure
- Main scene name - Combined

###### Explanation of Components: 
- Everything listed below needs to change!
- Spawn Points(1,2,3) - 2 player spawn points and 1 third person viewer spawn point. 
- NetworkManagerPhoton - The script manages the networking side of things. You can pass on spawn points and player prefab names. The player prefabs have to be kept in the Asset/Resources folder. (Requirement from Photon).
- NoloManager - Takes care of the controllers. There is a development app key that is already keyed in. In case you want to make your own project, it is - 4e4f4c4f484f4d457eff82725bc694a5(Otherwise it won't work). A camera needs to be assigned to the manager script which in our case is done by a script in the player prefab. 
- Room - The environment. (Horrible rendition of Marks room at ECL, ABI)

### Interaction
- Attach controllers at the end of the drumsticks for tracking
- Produces circles to hit based on music
- changes visualizations based on PLV(brain Synchronization).
